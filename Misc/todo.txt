I'm making really good progress on my project, 
I just gotta do some tweaking to my enemy management, 
improve the AI, 
make the UI look good, 
and QoL polish. 
Once I get it into a playable state I'm happy with, 
I can release it out in the wild, 
get multiplayer working and send that out afterward

Next thing to do:
Main menu and settings
